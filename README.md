- 👋 Hi, this is the @MetNet-CodingClubBCN  
  
- 👀 The Metabolism Network Coding Club (MNCC) aims to be a safe platform for continuous learning and
  practice in bioinformatics and data science for scientific data interpretation within our network.

- 🌱 We have three sections:
  + Beginners - in-person meetings to learn/share scientific data analysis pipelines for people new to
  biomedical/biological data analysis.
  + Experienced - virtual meetings to share pipelines and discuss statistical tests for biomedical/biological
  data analysis.
  + Senior - virtual meetings with information on how to approach and design the best omics approach to
  answer a research question. 

- 💞️ We want to create a peer-learning community of volunteers (learners & sharers) within our MetNet
  members to create long-standing fruitful scientific collaborations. 

- 📫 You can reach us by contacting our organizer: Ph.D. Tania Quesada-López (IIB-Sant Pau, IBUB)

- ⚡ What is MetNet?
  "The Cellular Signaling and Metabolism Section (Catalan Society of Biology) brings together scientists interested in
  how cells can interpret the signals they receive from the outside, by which mechanisms these signals are internalized,
  and how they modify cellular behavior. We are also interested in how cellular metabolism is regulated at the level
  of the enzymes involved and the metabolic fluxes and their hormonal control."
